## Overview
Logistic Regression is a type of regression analysis used for predicting the outcome of a categorical dependent variable. In this project, we use Logistic Regression to classify data into two possible outcomes (binary classification).

### Key Concepts:
- **Sigmoid Function**: Logistic Regression uses the sigmoid function to map predicted values to probabilities between 0 and 1.
- **Cost Function**: The cost function used in Logistic Regression is the **log loss** or **binary cross-entropy**.
- **Thresholding**: Predicted probabilities are converted to class labels based on a threshold (usually 0.5).

## Installation
